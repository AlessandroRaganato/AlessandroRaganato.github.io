This project is the main focus of my Ph.D. research.  
The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) can be interpreted as a complex, multidimensional dynamical system. Following Lucarini et al. (2016), we assume that the AMOC dynamics are confined to a lower-dimensional manifold (attractor).  

Our approach describes the AMOC using three key variables: streamfunction, freshwater transport, and potential temperature.  
Starting from this high-dimensional representation, we apply Isometric Mapping (Isomap) to construct a lower-dimensional manifold.  
This enables us to study the systemâ€™s dynamics from a lower-dimensional perspective, similar to classical PCA, but with the crucial advantage of accounting for nonlinear relationships.

By applying **local dimension** ($d(\zeta)$) and **persistence** ($\Theta$) metrics, we characterize the dynamics of the attractor, following the methodology of Falasca and Bracco (2022).  
Comparing these metrics across the three key variables also allows us to evaluate how much each variable contributes to the overall system dynamics.  

Through this framework, we can compare model simulations and reanalysis datasets to assess whether, and to what extent, models correctly represent the relative importance of each key variable.  
Preliminary results, including comparisons between four reanalysis products and two E3SM simulations, are shown in the figures attached.
