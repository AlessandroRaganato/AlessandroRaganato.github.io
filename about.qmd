I am a PhD in Physics of Climate and Oceanography. I work in the [Annalisa Bracco](https://sites.gatech.edu/annalisabracco/)'s group at the Georgia Institute of Technology. My studies focus on using **manifold learning** an **deep learning** to better understand and represent the dynamics of the **Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)**. In the past I also worked on advancing the understanding of tropical-to-extra-tropical atmospherical circulation.
