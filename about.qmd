## Research Interests
I work as a PhD student in the [Annalisa Bracco](https://sites.gatech.edu/annalisabracco/)'s group at the Georgia Institute of Technology. My studies focus on using **manifold learning** an **deep learning** to better understand and represent the dynamics of the **Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)**. In the past I also worked on advancing the understanding of tropical-to-extra-tropical atmospherical circulation.

## Education

Before starting my PhD I worked for one year at the [ICTP](https://www.ictp.it/esp) as a junior researcher. I obtained my MSc in Physics at the [University of Trieste](https://df.units.it), and my BSc in Physics at the [La Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.phys.uniroma1.it/it).
