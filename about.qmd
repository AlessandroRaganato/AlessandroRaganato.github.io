## Research Interests

I am a Ph.D. student in [Annalisa Bracco](https://sites.gatech.edu/annalisabracco/)'s group at the Georgia Institute of Technology.  
My research focuses on using **manifold learning** and **deep learning** to better understand and represent the dynamics of the **Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)**.  
In the past, I also worked on advancing the understanding of tropical-to-extratropical atmospheric circulation.

## Education

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked for one year at the [ICTP](https://www.ictp.it/esp) as a junior researcher.  
I obtained my M.Sc. in Physics at the [University of Trieste](https://df.units.it), and my B.Sc. in Physics at [La Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.phys.uniroma1.it/it).
